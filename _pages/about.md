I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Yale University. 
I am co-advised by Prof. [Richard E. Carson](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/richard-carson/) at [Yale PET Center](https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/) and Prof. [John A. Onofrey](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/john-onofrey/) at [IPAG](https://medicine.yale.edu/bioimaging/ipa/). 
My research topics are PET image reconstruction, registration, and data correction.
