I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Yale University, where I am fortunately co-advised by Prof. [Richard E. Carson](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/richard-carson/) at [Yale PET Center](https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/) and Prof. [John A. Onofrey](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/john-onofrey/) at [IPAG](https://medicine.yale.edu/bioimaging/ipa/). 
My current research mainly focuses on PET image reconstruction and data correction.
